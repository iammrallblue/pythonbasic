    Set Types — set, frozenset¶
        A set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects.
         Common uses include membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, 
         and computing mathematical operations such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric differenc
        Syntax:
            my_set ={1,2,3,4}
            compares to 
            my_dict = {"a":1,"b":2}
        Key point:
            1. set does not support slice[], and index,
            2. set is an unordered collection and no duplicated elements.
            3. it is similar with dict, but ONLY has Key, no values.
        Common functions:

"""
# set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# dict
# my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
