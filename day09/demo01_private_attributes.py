    Private Attributes (Variables):
        python doesnâ€™t have anything called private member variable in Python.
        However, adding two underlines(__) at the beginning makes a variable
        or a method private is the convention used by most python code.
        Syntax:
            __attribute = value
        Private Instance Attributes
            Key point:
                1. declare a private attribute/variable by adding "__" in front of
                    the private attribute, it can't directly use outside of the class
                    but inside of the class.
                2. however, the private attributes can indirectly access by the methods which defined
                    in the same class
                3. the private attribute can't be inherited by any derived classes.
                4.
                2. When using the private attributes (variables):
                    1. to hide the specific attribute, which means not allowed the accessing
                        from outside of the class
                    2. to keep value unchangeable.
                    3. to keep it inside of the class, prevent derived class inheriting
